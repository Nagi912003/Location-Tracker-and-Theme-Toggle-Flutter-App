**Location Tracker and Theme Toggle Flutter App**

This Flutter project focuses on a simple yet powerful functionality of retrieving the user's location coordinates (latitude and longitude). The app utilizes the "fl_location" package to seamlessly fetch and display the user's current location. Additionally, the project includes a theme toggle button to switch between light and dark themes. The app's codebase follows a well-organized folder structure, consisting of providers, screens, and widgets, to ensure maintainability and readability.

**Key Features:**
- Location tracking: The app uses the "fl_location" package to access and display the user's latitude and longitude coordinates.
- Theme toggle: Users can effortlessly switch between light and dark themes with a convenient toggle button.
- Provider-based state management: The "providers" folder contains the necessary classes and logic for managing the app's state, ensuring seamless updates and efficient reactivity.
- Clear folder structure: The project is structured into "screens" and "widgets" folders, enabling a clear separation between the main app screens and reusable UI components.
- Route management: The "AppRouter" class efficiently handles the app's routes, providing smooth navigation between different screens and enhancing the user experience.

**Folder Structure:**
- **providers:** Contains classes responsible for state management using the Provider package, including managing the app's theme and location data.
- **screens:** Holds the main screen of the app, where the user's location and theme toggle functionality are displayed.
- **widgets:** Contains reusable UI components used within the app, promoting code reusability and maintaining a modular approach.

**Usage:**
